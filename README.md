# Project: Build a campaign card front and back using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## To Run
run `index.html` on a local webserver, I used vscode's live server extension.
If ran without a local server there will be a cors error

## Prompt
### CSS
Please implement the [attached design](./../campaign_card.png) using HTML and CSS. You may use any css preprocessor such as less, sass, postcss, etc, but do not use a frontend css framework such as bootstrap. This portion of the homework is to assess your experience with writing css.

### JavaScript
For the JavaScript portion of the homework, you will be required to use ajax to pull in the included JSON file of donors and load it asynchronously on the back of the campaign card, and then sum the total number of donors and dollars. This portion of the homework is to assess your JavaScript skills and should be done using vanilla JavaScript, without the use of a front-end framework such as React, VueJS or jQuery.

## My questions:

### CSS portion:
I'm assuming that on load of the index.html file, we only see the card front, and there should be an action that triggers the card to turn & show the card back (like hover or click). 

`YES`

### Javascript portion: 
The only REST method that you would like me to work on is the initial GET request from the .json file on page load. 

`YES`

The "MAKE A GIFT" button should not trigger any action.

 `Correct`

## Questions: 
Which browser should I be focusing on?  

`- We support IE11, Edge, Safari, Chrome - Desktop and Mobile`

Would it be acceptable to use the fetch() instead of ajax? 

`- Depends which browsers support fetch() - will that work in IE/mobile browsers?`

Are there any kind of tests that you would like me to write? 

`- Bonus points if you write tests to verify your solution works, but not required.`

Is there a time limit you would like me to set on myself in writing this assignment?

`- No time limit...but most candidates can complete this in an hour or two`
